## Minesweeper game
### Start the Game:

The game starts with a grid of squares (usually 8x8, 9x9, or 10x10).
A certain number of mines are hidden beneath some of the squares.
### Clicking on a Square:

Click on a square on the grid to reveal it.
If the revealed square is empty, it will show either an empty space or a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it.
### If a Mine is Revealed:

If you reveal a square containing a mine, the game ends and you lose.
In some versions of the game, revealing a mine will end the game and reveal all the mines on the board.
### Flagging Mines:

If you suspect a square contains a mine, you can right-click on it to flag it as a mine.
Flagging a square with a right-click reinforces the indication of a mine.
### Ending the Game:

When all squares without mines are revealed, the game ends successfully.
In some versions of the game, correctly flagging all the mines may lead to an early completion of the game.
### How to Win:

The main objective is to reveal all squares without mines.
Successfully revealing all clear squares without clicking on a mine ensures victory.
### How to Lose:

If you reveal a square containing a mine, the game ends and you lose.
Minesweeper can be challenging and engaging, and you can play it repeatedly with different difficulty levels.<br/>
Try to avoid clicking on mines and correctly flag them to win at Minesweeper!<br/>
